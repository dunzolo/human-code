<p>Create a PHP form that allows you to submit two fields: a paragraph and a word to censor. Handle everything with two different files. The first file should allow the user to enter the data and submit the request to the server. The second file will receive the request and perform these operations: - print the paragraph and its length to the screen - print the paragraph and its length again, after replacing all occurrences of the word to be censored with three asterisks (***).</p>
